Greetings!

Thank you for taking the time to check out my Portfolio.

This project houses the culmination of the projects and learnings that
I have developed thus far!  It required alot of tinkering and messing 
around to get it to where it is, though it is far from being perfect, 
it is a step in the right direction.

This project has multiple links with corresponding navigation to both
within the web page and to external pages.  The web page layout should 
is responsive to the different webpage sizes for phones, ipads, and 
PCs.  Some links are just placeholders until more projects are deployed.
